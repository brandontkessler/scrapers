# Installs

Since I've always run into problems using twisted across versions, it seems easiest if running into errors to just list the packages needed to install via virtual environment below.

- Try recreating the virtual environment using a `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Troubleshooting: install homebrew

`brew install python3-dev`
